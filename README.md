# Dataset
You can request and download SUN-SEG dataset from https://github.com/GewelsJI/VPS.


# Preparation
The training and inference of DALA rely on deformable convolutions. You can find more details in http://github.com/lucasjinreal/DCNv2_latest.


# Prediction
You can find the prediction of DALA in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Px0-5oFQEH5rYIC32SM8wUFUBz_qLeOY/view?usp=drive_link) and [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11tmC32KuMO3OElcbS_pfLA) (2629).
